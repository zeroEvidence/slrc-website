    <p>
      The Lions have become lazy and have decided to select a new species to
      rule the animal kingdom. However, after discussing with the apes, they
      agreed that they are bored of ruthless displays of violence and physical
      dominance, and have decided to host a race. The race will consist of 7
      events, all from different categories, to give every species a fair
      chance. The chosen categories are: orienteering, swimming, running,
      skating, snow sports, cycling and motorsports. The species that performs
      the best in the race will be crowned the new rulers of the animal kingdom.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon hearing the news of the race, the leader of the Slow Loris species,
      Boris, began to prepare immediately. Now it may come as a surprise to most
      that the leader of one of the slowest species in the animal kingdom seemed
      excited about the idea of a competition based on speed. But Boris was
      tired of being judged and laughed at by the other animals, especially the
      Hyenas, for being small and slow; he was ready to prove everyone wrong.
      The Slow Loris is slow, but only by choice. And when it comes to attacking
      prey, they attack with lightning speed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Filled with pride, Boris called for an emergency meeting and assembled all
      4000* individual Lorises to the glade. He announced the news and discussed
      his intent to win the race and rule the animal kingdom. While the crowd
      was confused and doubtful, they cheered in admiration for his passion.
      Boris needed to divide the Lorises amongst the categories. However,
      considering every Loris was inexperienced in the chosen categories, and
      with little time to prepare, He had a plan to let the Lorises decide for
      themselves. After the assembly, every Loris was to go out and scavenge for
      equipment. They would then need to return to the glade to be assigned a
      category, according to the equipment they found.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually all the Lorises had returned and knew what event they were
      going to compete in. Some Lorises came back with particularly special
      equipment and received many glances as they walked past the other Lorises
      in the glade. And some Lorises must have been confused, as they returned
      with equipment that wasn't exactly suited for racing. However, this caused
      no division amongst the community as they were all united in their one
      goal, to win the race and rule the animal kingdom. And so it was formed,
      the Slow Loris Racing Club.
